1 EACH,"The Telewave ANT150D6-9 antenna consists of a 4-element dipole array with a precision phasing harness for optimum performance and one degree of electrical downtilt.  The wide bandwidth and high efficiency of these antennas make them ideal for many applications, including military communications and amateur radio. Each dipole element is constructed with 6061-T6 aluminum, and welded at the base for maximum strength. Each antenna is also completely sealed with our high-tech Txylan™ coating, which resists water and ice buildup, and provides exceptional protection from corrosive gases, UV radiation, salt spray, acid rain and windblown abrasives. The phasing harness is fully sealed by Telewave’s Millenium Seal™ technology. All components are at DC ground potential for lightning protection. Each dipole element includes a heavy-duty custom clamp set for mounting to a 1.5”-2.5” diameter galvanized steel support pipe or tower leg.

1 EACH,"The Telewave ANT260KT is an extremely rugged, wideband discone antenna for all frequencies between 75 MHz and 3 GHz. The wide vertical beamwidth of discone antennas allows clear communication for ground and ground-to-air applications. Low frequency response extends down to 75 MHz at 2:1 VSWR. Telewave discone antennas are designed to survive the most extreme conditions, where conventional antennas often fail. They are field-proven in US and overseas deployments and support many programs.  Each discone is constructed from Mil. Spec. 6061-T6 solid aluminum, fully welded at all joints for maximum strength. All internal junctions are enclosed within a ruggedized radome to ensure survivability in the worst environments. The radome and Txylan coating on all metal surfaces ensures complete protection from corrosive gases, ultraviolet radiation, salt spray, acid rain and sand storms in desert environments. The ANT260KT is designed to be clamped to a 1.5”-3.5” diameter galvanized steel support pipe.

1 EACH,"Ventev's TerraWave 2.4/5 GHz 6 dBi Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) directional Small Form Factor Wi-Fi antenna is designed to operate with Cisco's latest 802.11ac Waves I & II WLAN access points.  The antenna's gain and narrow beamwidths delivers on the modern user demand for high capacity connectivity while also addressing end user demand for smaller, more aesthetic antenna solutions.  4 dual-band leads deliver exceptional performance while simplifying connection to the access point.  The antenna can be ceiling mounted with screws that ship with the antenna.  It can also be paired with the Medium Strength Articulating Mount (SKU 506048) for mast or wall mounting.  An articulating mount enables the antenna to be pointed precisely where coverage is most needed, and comes with mounting hardware to support mast and/or wall mounting.   Every TerraWave antenna is RoHS compliant, and is covered by Ventev’s two-year TerraNet warranty program.

Constructed from heavy-duty steel with a durable black powder-coated finish, the cabinet has a maximum load capacity of 200 pounds.The front door features a shatter-resistant clear acrylic window that lets you monitor equipment readouts without unlocking the enclosure. Not only does the window help prevent equipment tampering and reduce acoustic noise, but it also adds visual flair to your IT installation.The cabinet swings away from the wall on a sturdy hinge, allowing easy back-door access to equipment and cabling during installation and maintenance. The doors and side panels lock securely to help prevent damage, tampering or theft. The top, bottom and removable side panels are vented, which allows air to flow freely and keep equipment cool. The reversible doors can open left or right by rotating the cabinet 180° before mounting. Convenient top and bottom ports allow easy cable routing.The SRW12USDPG comes fully assembled and ready to mount to the wall, or use Tripp Lite’s optional SRCASTER rolling caster kit to make it a mobile rack. Square and threaded mounting holes and numbered rack spaces make equipment installation easy.

1 EACH,"Telewave TGA Series in-line preamplifiers utilize PHEMT devices to amplify low-level RF signals by up to 18 dB. The primary application of these preamplifiers is to improve the noise figure of a receiver system to level as low as 0.4 dB. Preamps compensate for splitter insertion loss or losses from long coax cable runs, and increase signal levels to spectrum analyzers or other test equipment. Each preamplifier is housed in a rugged, custom made, RF-tight aluminum enclosure. The DC input is reverse polarity protected, and equipped with a high-pass filter to eliminate RFI.

The primary application of these preamplifiers is to improve the noise figure of a receiver system. Preamps compensate for splitter insertion loss or losses from long coax cable runs, and increase signal levels to spectrum analyzers or other test equipment. Each preamplifier is housed in a rugged, custom made, RF-tight aluminum enclosure. The DC input is reverse polarity protected, and equipped with a high-pass filter to eliminate RFI.

The top, bottom and removable side panels are vented, which allows air to flow freely through the cabinet to keep equipment cool. The reversible front door can open left or right by rotating the cabinet 180° before mounting. Convenient top and bottom ports allow easy cable routing through the cabinet.The SRW6UWG comes fully assembled and ready to mount to the wall (or use Tripp Lite’s optional SRCASTER caster kit to make it a mobile rolling rack).
