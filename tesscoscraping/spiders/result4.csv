1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.

1 FOOT,"For wireless networking professionals, Ventev’s coaxial cable offer the best value in the industry. Unlike other component suppliers, Ventev cable offer an unsurpassed combination of performance and price delivering upon customer expectations across thousands of wireless installations.  Featuring a non-halogenated, low smoke, fire retardant cable that is designed for easy installation and maximum flexibility where curves, bends and twists exist, this cable eliminates the need for hard-line transmission cables. In addition, 240FR-M cable has the added benefit of being MSHA approved for safe and reliable use in underground mining applications where critical safety standards apply as well as any indoor, non-plenum rated application requiring high-quality, flexible cabling.  Used in almost any application where handing characteristics, improved shielding, and low loss is required, this fire-retardant cable is similar in size to RG8X cables and fits 300 style connectors.  This 50 Ohm coax cable has a solid bare copper center conductor and a foam polyethylene serves as insulation. This braided coax cable offers similar performance compared to corrugated copper cables but provides high flexibility and simplified connectorization.
